abstract: "We address the problem of turbulent spontaneous ignition vs. deflagration propagating against a mean residence time gradient, particularly relevant to the stabilization of quasi-steady diesel flames and gas-turbine reheat combustion, by performing a large series of statistically one-dimensional premixed turbulent flame DNS. An autoignitve mixture of hydrogen-vitiated air representative of gas-turbine reheat combustion is considered. First, we demonstrate that turbulence can trigger the transition from spontaneous ignition to a deflagration. We then construct a spontaneous ignition vs. deflagration regime diagram based on inflow velocity, turbulent velocity fluctuations and integral length scale and identify the mechanism that governs the transition from one propagation mode to the other. Finally, we propose a theoretical model that captures accurately this transition and assess the validity of a proxy based on chemical explosive mode analysis to determine the local propagation mode in complex configurations."
