 abstract = {The development of usable visualization solutions is essential for ensuring both their adoption and effectiveness. User-centered design principles, which involve users throughout the entire development process, have been shown to be effective in numerous information visualization endeavors. We describe how we applied these principles in scientific visualization over a two year collaboration to develop a hybrid in situ/post hoc solution tailored towards combustion researcher needs. Furthermore, we examine the importance of user-centered design and lessons learned over the design process in an effort to aid others seeking to develop effective scientific visualization solutions.},
