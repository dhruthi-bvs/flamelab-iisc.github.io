<!-- A contingent from the lab consisting of Dr. Aditya, Anirudh, Shubham, Raj, Priyabrat and Dibyajyoti attended SIAM CSE'23 held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands from 26th February to 3rd March 2023. They presented their research work on the following themes:

- **Anirudh:** Application of co-kurtosis based reduced order models for combustion datasets
- **Shubham:** Stability analysis of the asynchronous discontinuous-Galerkin method
- **Raj:** A multiscale framework for hydrogen combustion: Chemical kinetic modelling via ReaxFF and ab-initio molecular dynamics
- **Priyabrat:** Reconstruction of unresolved small-scale structures in isotropic turbulence using deep learning
- **Dibyajyoti:** A co-kurtosis based dimensionality reduction with neural network based reconstruction of chemical kinetics in reacting flows 

We also congratulate Shubham for receiving the **SIAM Student Travel Award** and the **ODAA IISc Student Travel Grant**.

The conference, as well as the city of Amsterdam were an amazing experience filled with learning, networking, and fun! -->
