Shubham and Anirudh showcased their work as oral presentations on the following themes:

- **Anirudh:** A study of the fourth order joint statistical moment for dimensionality reduction of combustion datasets
- **Shubham:** A scalable asynchronous discontinuous-Galerkin method for massively parallel PDE solvers

Both received positive feedback for their presentations, which is a testament to their dedication and hard work. We are proud of their accomplishments and look forward to seeing the impact of their research on their respective fields.
